# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my first The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

It's the simple game of playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.
I've found it hard to make all the right choices in coding,
but with the right mindset and looking some things up on Google,
I think i've found the right answers and the code is working as intended.
I look forward to styling the page.

To make the game work for now type game() in console and the prompt will ask for your choice,
in the console you will see if you win or lose.
